# Granger-Causality
The project introduces Granger causal learning from multivariate temporal data, specifically focusing on its application in Financial Markets. By identifying causal features, the project aims to enhance the accuracy of forecasts and predictions within deep learning networks.

In traditional time series analysis, causal reasoning often relied on statistical correlations, which could lead to spurious relationships. To address these challenges, the project proposes Granger causality, offering a mechanism to avoid spurious regressions and identify causal directions between variables.

Implemented strategies involve Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to discover Granger causal features for bivariate and multivariate regression on time series data. The project aims to minimize empirical risk by incorporating causal features into the models.

Validation of the results involves reporting Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) for bivariate regression models and conducting hypothesis testing of Granger causality. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of including Granger causal features in improving model performance.
